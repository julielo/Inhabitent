# Project 4: Inhabitent

A WordPress project based on the starter theme for RED Academy students, forked from Underscores.

This project required customizations to the theme to incorporate functions, plugins, and widgets to simulate real client requests.

## Personal Learnings
* I am a visual learner and writing out the design of a site helps me to understand the structure of WordPress.

* The value of plugins and tools can be very helpful in identifying underlying issues in code or assist in making a website consistent across many browsers. The use of GULP makes a huge difference in how I work.

* WordPress: working with WordPress was and can be frustrating. To me, it feels like a black box with a lot of documentation to figure out how it ultimately works. It's much like working with someone else's code and documentation can be a bit cryptic which can lead to my frustration BUT this is what it's like being a Developer. One is always working with someone else's code...it's a part of the job description. At this moment, I'm not a huge fan of WordPress but like everything else, with more practice, I'm sure I'll improve my WordPress skills.

* Working with others: A few times on this project, I've run into a snag/roadblock and my peers/classmates were able to suggest a solution. We're not experts at everything but someone is bound to have encountered a similar issue or a different perspective. Asking for help (after a considerable amount of time troubleshooting) is never wrong.

* Colour calibration is important. I had trouble distinguishing the brand colours used for this project and discovered my computer was not colour calibrated when I compared the colours on my screen to a classmate's. I have not resolved this issue yet but I am aware there are third-party devices that can help me colour calibrate my screen.

* This project: as frustrating as it is, it is also satisfying figuring out how to work with this tool.

## Difficulties
* Aside from the amount of work involved in coding and styling, I also encountered issues where my stylesheets would not load (Gulp crashed at least once) which hampered my progress in completing this project.

## To Do
* Style the following pages: Main, Journal comment form, About, Find Us, 404, search-form

* fix search button

* Adventure section

* Resolve issue with Gulp and stylesheets
